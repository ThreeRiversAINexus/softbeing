# Spec writing

# The purpose of this code is to provide a CLI client
# for reviewing and fine-tuning samples collected

# It should also expose a class we can re-use for
# automated test suites.

# Finally, we want a vehicle for experimental coding
# but providing real sample data for analysis and re-use
# similar to the automated test suite
